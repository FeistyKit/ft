# Functional Tree

A clone of GNU 'tree,' but written in Haskell. It also includes a generator for the file tree.

## Running

``` sh
$ git clone git@github.com/FeistyKit/ft
$ make
$ ./treegen data
$ ./functree data
```
Requires [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/ghc/download.html) to run. 

## Why? 

This is to practise using Haskell and functional programming. As an additional challenge, I did not use listDirectoryRecursive, and implemented it myself.
